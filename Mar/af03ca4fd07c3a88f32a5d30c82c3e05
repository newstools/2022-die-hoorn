ANOTHER brilliant team effort was again the key ingredient for the Six Gun Grill SWD cricket team’s third consecutive victory in the Cricket South Africa Division 2 One Day competition.Captain Jean du Plessis and his troops were clinical as they recorded a very important 5 wicket bonus point victory against the Mpumlanga Rhino’s at White River on Wednesday and in the process climbed to the second position (14 points after 5 matches) on the log.This victory puts them in a favourable position to advance to the finals that will be played on 8 April. The Hollywoodbets Tuskers (17 points from 4 matches) are still the front runners on the table.The Rhino’s, who were put into bat first, were constantly put under pressure by the SWD bowling attack and with their total on 54/5 they had their backs against the wall. A 51-run partnership for the 6th wicket offered some resistance against the SWD bowlers; Renaldo Meyer (3/32 in 8,4 overs), Sintu Majiza (2/68 in 10 overs), Pheko Moletsane (3/35 in 10 overs) and an economical spell by Sean Whitehead (0/26 in 10 overs). The Rhino’s eventually reached 192 all out after 46,4 overs.The SWD run chase was built around a 75-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Jhedli van Brieiies (47 from 57 balls; 1×6, 3×4) and an unbeaten half century by Hanno Kotze (54*; 69 balls; 1×6, 5×4). SWD reached their target of 198/5 with 82 balls to spare.
