THEY might not have made the final cut for the Proteas women’s team that will be playing against Ireland in June, but Oudtshoorn’s Jané Winster and Micaela Andrews impressed Cricket South Africa (CSA) selectors enough to have been awarded two-year high-performance contracts ahead of the 2022/23 campaign as part of the development pipeline that caters for the national team.The contracted squad falls under the CSA high-performance structure, with the players closely monitored and going on to represent the SA Emerging side, while they are also invited to training camps featuring the Proteas Women players.Winster and Andrews form part of a 10-player list which includes six Protea-capped stars, including the trio that were chosen as the travelling reserves for South Africa at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup in New Zealand, in the form of Nadine de Klerk, Raisibe Ntozakhe and Andrie Steyn. The rest of the group is made up of budding cricketers, with Andrews recently crowned South Western District Player of the Season.All 10 of these players were in attendance at the recent Proteas national training camp held in Tshwane between 5 and 20 May.“The CSA high-performance contracts are offered to talented players who are part of the provincial system and are identified based on their performances and the skills set required at the national level,” CSA Senior Cricket Manager, Johan Weyers commented.
