Yesterday’s council meeting where a new speaker, mayor and deputy mayor for the Greater Oudtshoorn was elected, was unlawful, former mayor Chad Louw said in response last night. He added: “We as the ANC and ANC-led coalition will be taking legal action. All councillors who attended this meeting will bear the legal cost personally. “As the ANC we will continue fighting for our people, whether in government or in opposition. We will continue to re-establish the values and core principles for this town which encompasses uniting the people of Oudtshoorn, and we will continue with the struggle for fundamental political, social and economic change.” The new elected mayor, Chris Macpherson from the DA, however said this morning procedures followed at the council meeting were legal and that people are welcome to challenge that in court.
