ALL roads will lead to Calitzdorp in the heart of the Klein Karoo next week for Calitzdorp Expressed – an event that has grown out of the success of previous port festivals and the town’s recent Winter Festival.Calitzdorp Expressed will take place on the weekend of 17 to 19 June and promises to be a celebration of the vibrancy, creativity, tenacity and diversity of this small town.Calitzdorp, known as South Africa’s Port Capital, is world famous for its outstanding wine farms – Axe Hill, Boplaas, Calitzdorp Cellars, De Krans, Du’SwaRoo, TTT Cellars and Peter Bayly.During the Calitzdorp Expressed event visitors will be able to visit these wineries by using the town’s farm-style transport on two wine routes: the Tinta and the Hanepoot!The town’s many and varied eateries promise some unique experiences – from authentic Indian curries, “boerekos”, street food, fine dining, pizzas, pub meals and long table meals.Visitors will also be treated to the fine talent of residents – a range of excellent and diverse artists, musicians, choirs, dancers and pipe organ recitals. Succulent garden tours and historical walks will also be on the menu with the historical NG Kerk precinct where vistors will be able to enjoy a traditional country style “kerkbasaar”.A limited number of exclusive Calitzdorp Expressed Passports is available, which will give you free access to the town’s wine route transport, limited free tasting at each of the town’s wine farms and a #calitzdorpexpressed wine tasting glass. Your passport will have all the town’s participating venues detailed on a map and you will also be in line for spot prizes and a final super hamper.Follow Calitzdorp Expressed on Facebook: Calitzdorp Expressed and Instagram: #calitzdorpexpressed.
