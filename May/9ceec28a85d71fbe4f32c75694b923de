THE Western Cape Minister of Human Settlements, Tertius Simmers on Friday (29 April) visited the Dysselsdorp housing project site where 150 units will be built during the first phase of the project. This housing project of 522 units which will be built in three phases between 2021 and 2023, is a project of the Western Cape Government. It was launched by Simmers in October 2021. He then said that it was the first housing development project in over 26 years for the community of Dysselsdorp. The mayor of the Greater Oudtshoorn, Chad Louw, accompanied Simmers to Dysselsdorp. Louw told beneficiaries of the houses that they will be able to move in when the electrical work is completed.“All of us were excited when this housing project started. Let us finish the final step in the same spirit,” Louw added. During a briefing session at the Oudtshoorn Municipality earlier on Friday, Luwellyn Coetzee, acting director: strategic services, said the municipality received an allocation of approximately R90 million for the building of the houses, and that about 80% of the work force are from the Dysselsdorp area. According to Sylvia Tyatya, acting manager: human settlement, the housing department consulted with the beneficiaries of the 150 houses on 22 March 2022 and gave them feedback on the process. She said  the oldest person moving into one of the houses was born in 1936.
